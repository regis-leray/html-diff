== Overview ==
the diff generated by "svn diff" or "cvs diff" or something else?  I beleive
that would bring a lot of pain to the reviewers - raw diffs are difficult to

Coderev is just the thing you need for effective code review.  Coderev is a

  * Compares files/dirs and generates side-by-side html pages
  * Generates side-by-side html pages on your SVN working copy
  * More (TODO)
  * More (TODO)

* usage

    (optional) cp coderevrc.sample ~/.coderevrc, customize your own
    cd your-workspace
    coderev.sh [-r revsion] [-w width] [file|subdir ...]
   
    `width' is a number to make code review pages wrap in specific column

    Default `subdir' is working dir.

    Example 1:
    coderev.sh -w80 bin lib

    Generate coderev based on your working copy, web pages wrap in column 80.
    If you are working on the most up-to-date version, this is suggested way
    (faster).
