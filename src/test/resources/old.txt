  * Generates side-by-side html pages on your SVN working copy

* usage

    coderev.sh [-r revsion] [file|subdir ...]

    `revision' is a revision number, or symbol (PREV, BASE, HEAD), see svn
    books for details.  Default revision is revision of your working copy
    (aka. BASE)

    Default `subdir' is working dir.

    Example 1:
    coderev.sh bin lib

    Generate coderev based on your working copy.  If you are working on the
    most up-to-date version, this is suggested way (faster).
